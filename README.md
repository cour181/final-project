Cleo Johnson is an up and coming Tech entrepreneur in New York City.  Currently she is in a second round of her ”pitch and prospecting phase"  for angel investors for her startup.  Johnson’s new "all-in-one" digital tool allows entrepreneurial women of color-on an unprecedented global scale- to explore, walk-through, and experience creating a highly successful business from initial idea-phase evaluation to successful financing and further growth.  	This innovative tool includes the full integration of global research databases, funding sources.  It’s social side features include direct match networking, direct critical feedback from persons experienced in their field, sharing of ideas and resources, both direct and reverse mentoring, and networking to say the least.  It’s walk-through also includes advanced enterprise grade AI features previously not available as well as product modeling.  
	Cleo needs a quick web application that takes up minimal time to create in terms of the her staff’s time and resources; isn’t sleek or attractive (this is a perk because the awkwardness of the design is used to pique an investor’s interest: “this little weird looking thing that works so quickly” is “just a small beta project that my/the engineering team is playing with”);
keep prospects curious and provides the specific functionality she needs just for this phase.  Programmatically it was made in HTML and JavaScript and includes a objects and arrays and a required 3 event listeners and can be seen on GitHub.  On the UI side Cleo needs to keep track of important and relevant notes; access her notes as well as keep everything organized; Add new notes, Delete Notes; call to action buttons; and lastly a way to visually tell which notes are most important.
